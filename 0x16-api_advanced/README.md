# Overview #

## Background Context ##
Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.

I love this!!!

## Learning Objectives ##
At the completion of this project, we are expected to have full understanding of thefollowing:

- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value

If an invalid subreddit is given, the function returns 0.<br>**Hint:* *No authentication is necessary for most features of the Reddit API. If you’re getting errors related to Too Many Requests, ensure you’re setting a custom User-Agent.* <br/><br/>Requirements:<br/><ul><li>Prototype: def number_of_subscribers(subreddit)</li><li>If not a valid subreddit, return 0.<br/>**NOTE:** *Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.*|
