# Overview #

## Background Context ##
In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out itâ€™s not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests.

For the benchmarking, we are using [ApacheBench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/ab.html) which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows us to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. For starters, we have a serverto which we  made 2000 requests with 100 requests at a time. 696 requests failed - this may vary from time to time, but it's still bad because if 700/2000 requests are failing, it translates to 35% of our users complaining! Our first task is to  fix our stack so that we get failures down to 0, using our Werkzeugsatz - *German for toolkit* ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ§°


In second scenaria, we are prensented with a server which has a user *holberton*. However, when `su - holberton` is attempted, the error `-su: /home/holberton/.bash_profile: Too many open files` pops up. Our task is to resolve this issue and write a puppet manifest to automate it. Nice ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤©
